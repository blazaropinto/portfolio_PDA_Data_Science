Looking at the [DS project example](https://github.com/Data-Education-in-Schools/CityFibre-L6-pyexemplar) in moodle and thinking of the work/agreements made so far, we could try to end up with something like a github repository with the following content (***please amend / comment on it*** - *this is just a first attempt to structure that*)

---

> **1.	Data analysis challenge pdf**

That should be a text file explaining the following sections:

    1. Background
General idea and purpose of project

***Ability** and **willingness** to adapt transport mode to help the fight against climate change* - comparison through visualization of:

* accessibility of bike shares schemes in Edinburgh districts (focus on deprived/wealthy areas)

* Edinburgh people attitude towards active travel/the spaces for people iniciative... conclusions… affordability in climate change adaptation…?

* To be explained to xxx audience in xxx way trying to address the following DS problem


---

    2. Problem(s)

* Is the ***ability*** to reduce carbon foot print through change of transport habits linked to wealth inequality? How?

    * Are bike share schemes inclusive? 
        * points of view: 
            * economic (access to bikes of poorer families)
            * general occupation 
                * workers
                * tourists
                * students

    * Has that changed over the years? 

* Is the ***willingness*** to reduce carbon foot print through change of transport habits linked to wealth inequality?

    3. Datasets used approach 

* Just Eat bike share scheme
* Deprivation Areas Edinburgh
* Edinburgh survey on people attitudes					

---

    4. Approach 
Explain steps taken-from data cleaning to communication. All these points should be far better explained...
* Microsoft Excel for initial cleaning of smaller datasets
* Python libraries like pandas for initial cleaning of larger datasets
* Tableau for creation of data story about Edinburgh people attitude with different images
* Streamlit, Geopandas, Folium (Python) to create dynamic visualizations on Edinburgh maps of bike stations vs deprived areas
* X software to communicate / celiver conclusions?

---

    5. Supporting information
Links to information used

---

    6. Possible extensions 
* What would be the initial conclusion? 
* How can that work be continued? (other audiences? Further data? Following years evolution? May comment why is the work important..)

---

> **2.	Code subfolder**

* `.ipynb` files with Python code inside headings plus lots of explanations in markdown for every step taken.
* Text file explaining in detail all the steps taken in Excel and Tableau (pdf file with lots of bullet points?)

> **3.	Data subfolder**

Subfolder containing all `.csv` files

---
---

> **4.	Other documentation subfolder**

Other resources like text document where ideas where obtained, `.text` or `.pdf` files, news, etc

---
---

> **5.	Worked answers subfolder**

Outputs like `.html` or `.ppt` or `.csv` of Tableau repository link
